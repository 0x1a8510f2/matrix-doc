# MSCXXXX: Room Version 7

A new room version, `7`, is proposed using [room version 6](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v6.html) as a base
and incorporating the following MSCs:

* [MSC2176](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2176) - Update the redaction rules.
* [MSC2403](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403) - Add "knock" feature.


Though other MSCs are capable of being included in this version, they do not have sufficient implementation to be
considered stable enough for v7 rooms. A future room version may still include them.

Room version 7 upon being added to the specification shall be considered stable. No other room versions are affected
by this MSC.
