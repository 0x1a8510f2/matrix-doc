Matrix Spec Design Workflow
===========================

1. Write use cases

2. Design data flows for use cases

3. Design generic API (factoring out commonalities where possible)

4. Design transport-specific API with justifications

5. Formalise transport-specific API as swagger or similar

6. Evolve the generic API design doc and transport-specific API into the actual spec.
