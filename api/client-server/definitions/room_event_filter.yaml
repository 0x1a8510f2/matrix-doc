  title: RoomEventFilter
  properties:
    lazy_load_members:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        If ``true``, the only ``m.room.member`` events returned
        are those which are definitely necessary for a client to
        display the ``sender`` of the timeline events in the response.
        If ``false``, ``m.room.member`` events are not filtered.
        By default, servers should suppress duplicate redundant
        lazy-loaded ``m.room.member`` events from being sent to a given
        client across multiple calls, given that most clients
        cache membership events (see ``include_redundant_members``
        to change this behaviour).

        Only applicable when filtering state events, such as the
        ``state`` section of a ``/sync`` or ``/messages``.
    include_redundant_members:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        If ``true``, response will always contain the ``m.room.member``
        events required to display the ``sender`` of the timeline events
        in that response, assuming ``lazy_load_members`` is enabled. This
        means that redundant duplicate member events may be returned across
        multiple calls to. This is useful for naive clients who never track
        membership data. If ``false``, duplicate ``m.room.member`` events
        may be suppressed by the server across multiple calls. If
        ``lazy_load_members`` is ``false`` this field is ignored.

        Only applicable when filtering state events, such as the
        ``state`` section of a ``/sync`` or ``/messages``.
    not_rooms:
      description: A list of room IDs to exclude. If this list is absent then no rooms
        are excluded. A matching room will be excluded even if it is listed in the ``'rooms'``
        filter.
      items:
        type: string
      type: array
    rooms:
      description: A list of room IDs to include. If this list is absent then all rooms
        are included.
      items:
        type: string
      type: array
    contains_url:
      type: boolean
      description: If ``true``, includes only events with a ``url`` key in their content. If
        ``false``, excludes those events. If omitted, ``url`` key is not considered for filtering.
