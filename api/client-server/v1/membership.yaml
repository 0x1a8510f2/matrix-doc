      description: |-
        This API starts a user participating in a particular room, if that user
        is allowed to participate in that room. After this call, the client is
        allowed to see all current state events in the room, and all subsequent
        events associated with the room until the user leaves the room.

        After a user has joined a room, the room will appear as an entry in the
        response of the |initialSync| API.

            The joined room ID must be returned in the ``room_id`` field.

            You do not have permission to join the room. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection are:
              - The room is invite-only and the user was not invited.
              - The user has been banned from the room.

      description: |-
        This API invites a user to participate in a particular room.
        They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the
        room.

        This serves two purposes; firstly, to notify the user that the room
        exists (and that their presence is requested). Secondly, some rooms can
        only be joined if a user is invited to join it; sending the invite gives
        that user permission to join the room.

        Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to
        join that room.

            You do not have permission to invite the user to the room. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejections are:
              - The invitee has been banned from the room.
              - The invitee is already a member of the room.
              - The inviter is not currently in the room.
              - The inviter's power level is insufficient to invite users to the room.

            application/json: |-
              {"errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN", "error": "@cheeky_monkey:matrix.org is banned from the room"}
