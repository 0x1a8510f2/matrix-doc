r0
===

This is the first release of the client-server specification. It is largely a dump of what has currently been implemented, and there are several inconsistencies.

An upcoming minor release will deprecate many of these inconsistencies, and they will be removed in the next major release.

Since the draft stage, the following major changes have been made:
- /api/v1 and /v2_alpha path segments have been replaced with the major version of the release (i.e. 'r0').
- The specification has been split into one specification per API. This is the client-server API. The server-server API can be found documented separately.
