Address book repository
=======================

.. NOTE::
  This section is a work in progress.
  Do we even need it?  Clients can use out-of-band addressbook servers for now;
  this should definitely not be core.

.. TODO-spec
  - format: POST(?) wodges of json, some possible processing, then return wodges of json on GET.
  - processing may remove dupes, merge contacts, pepper with extra info (e.g. matrix-ability of
    contacts), etc.
  - Standard json format for contacts? Piggy back off vcards?
