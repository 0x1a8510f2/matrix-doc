Matrix Specification
====================

.. Note that this file is specifically unversioned because we don't want to
.. have to add Yet Another version number, and the commentary on what specs we
.. have should hopefully not get complex enough that we need to worry about
.. versioning it.

This specification has been generated from
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc using
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/scripts/gendoc.py as of
revision ``{{git_version}}`` -
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/{{git_rev}}.

There is an `introduction and overview to the specification here <intro.html>`_.

The following APIs are documented in this specification:

- `Client-Server API <client_server.html>`_ version %CLIENT_RELEASE_LABEL% for writing Matrix clients.
- `Server-Server API <server_server.html>`_ version %SERVER_RELEASE_LABEL% for writing servers which can federate with Matrix.
- `Application Service API <application_service.html>`_ version %CLIENT_RELEASE_LABEL% for writing privileged plugins to servers.

There are also some `appendices <appendices.html>`_.

Any developments since the latest release can be found `here`__.
