.. This file is automatically processed by the templating system. To make it
.. happy, you MUST use '=' as the title underline and you MUST stick the version
.. in the title. The version MUST follow the numbering format 
.. "v<num>.<num>.<num>" - You cannot use a-z. If the templating system fails to
.. find the right info, it will be treated as a test failure and so will show up
.. in Jenkins. Comments like this are ignored by both RST and the templating
.. system.
