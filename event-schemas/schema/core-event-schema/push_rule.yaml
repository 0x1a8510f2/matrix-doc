            Required for ``event_match`` conditions. The glob-style pattern to
            match against. Patterns with no special glob characters should be
            treated as having asterisks prepended and appended when testing the
            condition.

            Required for ``room_member_count`` conditions. A decimal integer
            optionally prefixed by one of, ==, <, >, >= or <=. A prefix of < matches
            rooms where the member count is strictly less than the given number and
            so forth. If no prefix is present, this parameter defaults to ==.
