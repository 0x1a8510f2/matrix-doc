===================
Documentation Style
===================

A brief single sentence to describe what this file contains; in this case a
description of the style to write documentation in.


Sections
========

Each section should be separated from the others by two blank lines. Headings
should be underlined using a row of equals signs (===). Paragraphs should be
separated by a single blank line, and wrap to no further than 80 columns.

[[TODO(username): if you want to leave some unanswered questions, notes for
further consideration, or other kinds of comment, use a TODO section. Make sure
to notate it with your name so we know who to ask about it!]]

Subsections
-----------

If required, subsections can use a row of dashes to underline their header. A
single blank line between subsections of a single section.


Bullet Lists
============

 * Bullet lists can use asterisks with a single space either side.
 
 * Another blank line between list elements.


Definition Lists
================

Terms:
  Start in the first column, ending with a colon

Definitions:
  Take a two space indent, following immediately from the term without a blank
  line before it, but having a blank line afterwards.
