speculator allows you to preview pull requests to the matrix.org specification.

It serves the following HTTP endpoints:
 - / lists open pull requests
 - /spec/123 which renders the spec as html at pull request 123.
 - /diff/rst/123 which gives a diff of the spec's rst at pull request 123.

To run it, you must install the `go` tool, and run:
 `go run main.go`
