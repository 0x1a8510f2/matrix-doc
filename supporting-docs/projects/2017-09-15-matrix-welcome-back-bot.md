# {{ page.title }}

[@welcomeback:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@welcomeback:t2bot.io) is a silly bot that welcomes people back to the conversation after they've been inactive for a period of time. Welcome Back Bot also demonstrates basic functionality of the js-sdk, spawned from [#offtopic:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#offtopic:matrix.org).

The source (and more information) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-welcome-back-bot).
