Matrix.orgâ€™s reference Android client.

This client is meant to be a showcase of Matrix capabilities, a reference implementation of the Matrix standard and an easy entry to the Matrix ecosystem from Android devices for less techy users,  with a relatively neutral branding.

The code can be retrieved from [github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console).

Also available from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha).

Folks wanting to live on the bleeding edge can also pull APKs of the develop (and master) branches straight out of the [Jenkins build server](http://matrix.org/jenkins/job/AndroidConsoleDevelop/).
